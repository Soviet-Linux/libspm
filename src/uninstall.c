// Function to uninstall packages
/*
Accepts:
- char* name: The name of the package to uninstall.

Returns:
- int: An integer indicating the result of the uninstallation.
  - 0: The package was successfully uninstalled.
  - -1: An error occurred during the uninstallation.

Description:
This function is used to uninstall packages. It relies on location data, which
contains all the files that were installed by the program. This data is stored
in a JSON array inside the package's SPM file in DATA_DIR. The function cycles
through all the files in the JSON array and removes them from the system. It
also removes the package's entry from the installed packages database.

Note:
- The variable `DEFAULT_FORMAT` is not defined; you may need to replace it with
the correct environment variable or value. For example, you can use
`getenv("SOVIET_DEFAULT_FORMAT")` or replace it with a string representing the
default format.
- The `INSTALLED_DB` variable is assumed to be defined elsewhere in your code.

Please avoid making changes to this code unless there's a critical bug or an
important missing feature.
