Description:
This function is used to uninstall packages. It relies on location data, which contains all the files that were installed by the program. This data is stored in a JSON array inside the package's SPM file in DATA_DIR. The function cycles through all the files in the JSON array and removes them from the system. It also removes the package's entry from the installed packages database.

Note:
- The variable `DEFAULT_FORMAT` is not defined; you may need to replace it with the correct environment variable or value. For example, you can use `getenv("SOVIET_DEFAULT_FORMAT")` or replace it with a string representing the default format.
- The `INSTALLED_DB` variable is assumed to be defined elsewhere in your code.

Please avoid making changes to this code unless there's a critical bug or an important missing feature.
